# CSI-Assignment6 â€” Celebal Technologies Summer Internship

Welcome to **Week 6 Assignment** of the **Celebal Technologies Summer Internship - Summer 2025**, under the **SQL** domain. As part of this week's task, I was given the flexibility to solve **any LeetCode SQL problems of my choice** to demonstrate my proficiency in SQL querying, database concepts, and performance optimization.

This repository titled `CSI-Assignment6` showcases a structured compilation of selected LeetCode problems, along with detailed solution records and performance statistics.
